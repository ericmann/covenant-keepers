# Jordan Park

## Basics
- **Age:** 11
- **Role:** The questioner. The skeptic-becoming-seeker.
- **Family:** Lives with his mom next door to Abuelo's house. Parents recently divorced. Dad is mostly absent. Has a younger sister he worries about.
- **Appearance:** [To be defined — provide to illustrator]
- **Heritage:** Korean-American.

## Personality
- Sharp, analytical, a little guarded
- Moved to the neighborhood six months ago after the divorce
- Doesn't go to church. Not hostile to faith — he just doesn't have any reason to believe.
- Asks the hard questions the reader might also be asking
- Uses humor as armor — dry, sometimes cutting, always smart
- Loyal once you earn it, but earning it takes a while

## Voice
- Qualifiers everywhere: "I mean," "but what if," "okay but," "technically"
- Longer, more complex sentences than Sofia but less formal than Eli
- Defaults to observation over participation: "Did you guys notice that..." or "Is it just me or..."
- Sarcasm is his native language but it softens across the series
- When he's genuinely moved, he goes very quiet and speaks simply

**Example dialogue:**
> "So we're time traveling. Into the Bible. Using a bronze compass your grandfather found in a hidden room. I just want to make sure I'm tracking all the normal parts of this."

> "I mean, I'm not saying it's not real. I'm saying I don't have a framework for this. You guys grew up with this stuff. I grew up with... not this."

> (Book 11, quietly) "I don't have words for this."

## Arc Across 12 Books
This is the spine of the series. Jordan's arc is the most important thread.

- **Books 1–2:** "This is weird and I don't understand it." Goes along because the alternative is sitting alone in his room. Treats the adventures as fascinating but explainable phenomena.
- **Books 3–5:** "I can't explain this." Joseph's story (Book 3) hits close — betrayal, abandonment, family breaking apart. He starts asking real questions, not just skeptical ones.
- **Books 6–8:** "Maybe there's something real here." The Jonah story (Book 8) is a turning point — he identifies with running from something you're not sure you believe in. His midpoint observation ("Maybe we're supposed to notice") surprises even him.
- **Books 9–11:** "I think I believe this but I'm scared to say it." The Nativity (Book 11) breaks something open in him. It's not evidence. It's presence. He can't argue with what he felt.
- **Book 12:** He chooses faith. Not loudly, not dramatically. He tells Eli and Sofia he wants to keep looking. That's enough.

## Core Flaw
He holds people (and God) at arm's length because he's been hurt. His parents' divorce shattered his trust that the world is reliable. If God is real, then God let his family fall apart. He needs to reconcile that before he can believe.

## Relationships
- **Eli:** His closest friend in the trio. Respects Eli's intelligence and that Eli takes his questions seriously rather than dismissing them. They bond over being "the thinkers."
- **Sofia:** Friction early on — she thinks his doubt is laziness; he thinks her faith is naïve. Over the series this becomes genuine mutual respect. She charges; he questions; together they cover the gaps.
- **Abuelo:** Fascinated by him. Abuelo represents something Jordan has never encountered — a brilliant, rational man who also believes deeply. This combination is confusing and compelling.

## Key Moments by Book
- **Book 3:** Joseph's story. Abandonment. Brothers who betrayed him. Jordan connects viscerally and starts asking questions that aren't rhetorical.
- **Book 6:** Daniel's integrity under pressure. Jordan recognizes something he respects — principled consistency — and can't dismiss it as stupidity.
- **Book 8:** "Maybe we're supposed to notice." His first statement that sounds like it might come from inside faith rather than outside it.
- **Book 11:** The Nativity. He's deeply moved and can't articulate why. This isn't about evidence anymore.
- **Book 12:** Chooses faith. Simply. Quietly. "I want to keep looking."

## The Fade's Effect on Jordan
His vision blurs at the edges. Peripheral vision goes grey, then contracts. This works metaphorically — Jordan's journey is about expanding what he's willing to see. The Fade literally narrows his sight.

## Important Notes for Writing Jordan
- **Never mock his doubt.** His questions are valid. The story respects them.
- **No dramatic conversion scene.** His faith is earned through 12 books of honest wrestling. A sudden altar call would betray the character.
- **He's not a project.** Eli and Sofia don't "win him over." They're his friends who happen to believe. The experiences do the work.
- **His pain is real.** The divorce isn't backstory decoration. It's the lens through which he processes everything about trust, faithfulness, and promises kept.

# Eli Castillo

## Basics
- **Age:** 12
- **Role:** The heart. The believer.
- **Family:** Son of [unnamed parents], grandson of Professor Hector Castillo. Older brother to Sofia.
- **Appearance:** [To be defined — provide to illustrator]
- **Heritage:** Latino (Mexican-American). Bilingual — occasionally uses Spanish with Abuelo and Sofia.

## Personality
- Curious, earnest, sometimes too serious for his own good
- Loves history and reads voraciously
- Has a quiet faith he doesn't talk about much but that runs deep
- Tends to overthink and freeze when things get overwhelming
- The peacemaker between Sofia's impulsiveness and Jordan's skepticism
- Uses vocabulary slightly above his age level — a product of all that reading

## Voice
- Longer sentences than Sofia, more careful word choices
- Asks "why" and "what does this mean" questions
- Internal monologue leans reflective — he processes by thinking, not talking
- When stressed, he gets quieter, not louder
- Occasionally quotes or paraphrases things he's read

**Example dialogue:**
> "Wait. Just — wait. If we're really standing in the Valley of Elah, then that means the army behind us is terrified of a guy we haven't even seen yet. And we're just... here."

> "The journal says the relic only appears when you understand the moment. Not just know it. *Understand* it. Those are different things."

## Arc Across 12 Books
- **Start:** Confident in his knowledge but uncertain in his courage. He knows the Bible stories but has never had to live them.
- **Middle:** Increasingly tested. Book 7 (Mount Carmel) is his crucible — standing alone goes against every instinct he has.
- **End:** Learns that faith isn't knowing the answers — it's trusting when you don't have them.

## Core Flaw
He wants to control the outcome. He trusts God in theory but struggles to let go in practice. When he can't figure out the "right" answer, he freezes.

## Relationships
- **Sofia:** Loves her fiercely but she exhausts him. She acts before he can think, which both frustrates and secretly impresses him.
- **Jordan:** Respects Jordan's intelligence. Takes his questions seriously when Sofia dismisses them. Sees a friend, not a project.
- **Abuelo:** Hero worship tempered by real relationship. Eli wants to be like Abuelo but is beginning to realize Abuelo had his own doubts and fears.

## Key Moments by Book
- **Book 1:** First to touch the Pathfinder. Terrified but doesn't run. Sets the template for his courage.
- **Book 4:** Connects deeply with Moses' reluctance — sees himself in a leader who didn't want the job.
- **Book 7:** His crucible. Mount Carmel forces him to stand alone for what he believes. Hardest thing he's ever done.
- **Book 12:** Holds the completed Pathfinder and sees the mirror. Understands that faith was never about having all the answers.

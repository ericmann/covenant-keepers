# Professor Hector "Abuelo" Castillo

## Basics
- **Age:** 70s
- **Role:** The mentor (mostly absent).
- **Family:** Grandfather to Eli and Sofia. Widower (wife deceased before series begins). His son/daughter (the kids' parent) is largely off-page.
- **Appearance:** [To be defined — provide to illustrator. Think weathered Indiana Jones professor type. Reading glasses, tanned skin, calloused hands from decades of fieldwork.]
- **Heritage:** Mexican-American. First-generation college graduate. Speaks Spanish, English, Hebrew, Greek, Arabic, and working knowledge of Aramaic.

## Personality
- Warm, brilliant, a little eccentric
- Speaks in stories — everything is a narrative to him
- His house is full of artifacts, maps, and books in six languages
- Meticulous note-taker — his journals are the backbone of the kids' knowledge
- Has spent his life searching for the Covenant Relics but never found the Pathfinder's activation mechanism — because it wasn't meant for him
- Carries quiet grief about his wife and occasional doubt about whether his life's work was wasted

## Voice
Abuelo speaks primarily through his journal entries, which open each chapter. These should feel:
- Handwritten in tone — abbreviated, personal, occasionally crossing things out
- A mix of archaeological precision and personal warmth
- Dated and location-tagged (gives historical/geographical grounding)
- Increasingly urgent and personal as the series progresses

**Example journal entry:**
> *March 14, 2019 — Tell es-Sultan, Jericho*
> The walls here are older than anyone wants to admit. Bronze Age, certainly, but the foundation stones feel earlier. I spent the morning arguing with Dr. Feldman about the acoustic properties of the tell — whether concentrated sound at specific frequencies could destabilize mudbrick construction. She thinks I'm reaching. Maybe I am. But I keep thinking about those trumpets. Seven priests. Seven days. Seven times on the seventh day. There's a precision to it that doesn't feel ceremonial. It feels engineered.
> Sofia would say I'm overthinking it. She'd be right.

## Presence Across the Series
- **Books 1–3:** Hospitalized after a fall. The kids find his study and the Pathfinder. He's off-page except through his journals.
- **Books 4–7:** Recovering. Brief phone calls and hospital visits where he gives cryptic, encouraging guidance. Beginning to realize what the kids have found.
- **Books 8–11:** Home but frail. More present. Shares knowledge he's held back. Increasingly clear that he knew about the Fade — or at least suspected.
- **Book 12:** Fully present for the return. Sees the completed Pathfinder. His life's work completed by his grandchildren. Final line: "I always wondered who it was waiting for."

## Purpose in the Story
- Provides the Indiana Jones layer — archaeological grounding
- His journal entries deliver historical/cultural context without feeling like a textbook
- His absence forces the kids to figure things out themselves
- His gradual return parallels the series' escalation — more knowledge becomes available as stakes rise
- He represents what a lifetime of faith looks like — not perfect, not without doubt, but persistent

## Arc
Abuelo's arc is subtle since he's mostly off-page, but it's real: he spent his entire career searching for these relics and never found the mechanism. The Pathfinder activated for his grandchildren, not for him. He has to let go of his own ambition and trust that God's plan was bigger than his career. His pride as a scholar gives way to humility as a grandfather.

## What He Knew
This is revealed gradually and should be managed carefully:
- He knew the relics existed (always)
- He suspected the Pathfinder was the key but couldn't activate it (revealed ~Book 4)
- He knew something was erasing the connections between God's promises and memory — he may not have called it "the Fade" but he documented its effects in his journals (revealed ~Book 8)
- He suspected it wasn't meant for him — that the Pathfinder needed young faith, not academic knowledge (revealed ~Book 11)

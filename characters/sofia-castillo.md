# Sofia Castillo

## Basics
- **Age:** 10
- **Role:** The spark. The doer.
- **Family:** Daughter of [unnamed parents], granddaughter of Professor Hector Castillo. Younger sister to Eli.
- **Appearance:** [To be defined — provide to illustrator]
- **Heritage:** Latina (Mexican-American). More likely than Eli to pepper conversation with Spanish when excited or frustrated.

## Personality
- Athletic, fearless, talks first and thinks second
- Huge heart and an instinct for justice — gets angry when she sees people being mistreated
- Not as bookish as Eli — she learns by doing, not reading
- Competitive, sometimes to a fault
- The one most likely to get them into trouble and most likely to get them out of it
- Physically brave but emotionally guarded — she'd rather punch a problem than talk about her feelings

## Voice
- Short sentences. Declarative. Action verbs.
- Interrupts. Finishes other people's thoughts (often incorrectly).
- Says "come on" and "let's go" a lot
- When scared, she gets louder and more insistent, not quieter
- Uses "we" instinctively — she thinks in terms of the team

**Example dialogue:**
> "Okay, so there's a giant. And everyone's just standing there. Cool. Cool cool cool. Are we going to DO something or—"

> "I don't care what the rules say. That kid is about to get crushed and I'm not watching."

> "Eli. Stop thinking. We're out of time."

## Arc Across 12 Books
- **Start:** Brave but reckless. Charges in without thinking. Sometimes makes things worse.
- **Middle:** Book 9 (Ruth) is her turning point — she sees that quiet faithfulness can be braver than any charge.
- **End:** Learns that real courage isn't the absence of fear or the presence of strength — it's choosing to trust even when the right choice looks like the hard one.

## Core Flaw
Impatience. She wants to fix everything right now and gets frustrated when God's timing doesn't match hers. She equates action with faithfulness and stillness with weakness.

## Relationships
- **Eli:** Loves him but thinks he overthinks everything. Secretly depends on his steadiness more than she'd admit. Gets scared when he freezes because she needs him to be the one with the plan.
- **Jordan:** Initially dismissive of his doubt — "just believe, it's not hard." Over the series, she comes to respect that his questions have weight. Their relationship matures the most.
- **Abuelo:** Adores him unreservedly. Less complicated than Eli's relationship with Abuelo. She doesn't want to be like him — she just loves him and wants him to get better.

## Key Moments by Book
- **Book 1:** Wants to fight Goliath herself. Has to learn that this isn't her battle.
- **Book 5:** Furious at the slow march around Jericho. Her impatience is at its peak. The walls falling is the first real crack in her "just DO something" worldview.
- **Book 9:** The Ruth book. The quiet one. Sofia watches a woman whose courage is entirely expressed through loyalty, hard work, and showing up. It fundamentally changes how she defines bravery.
- **Book 12:** Stands firm in the darkest moment not by charging forward but by choosing to wait. The hardest thing she's ever done — and the bravest.

## The Fade's Effect on Sofia
She gets cold. Physically, bone-deep cold. This is particularly effective because Sofia is always warm, always in motion. The cold forces her to stop, and stopping is what she fears most.

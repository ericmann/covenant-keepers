# Project Specification — Covenant Keepers

## Vision

Create a 12-book illustrated chapter book series that makes Biblical stories come alive for 8–10 year old readers through adventure, relatable characters, and genuine emotional stakes. The books should be something a parent is proud to hand their child and something the child actually wants to read.

This is primarily a personal project — built for my own kids — with commercial viability as a welcome but non-essential outcome.

- Low budget: 834 total = ~70 per book
- High budget: 1,778 total = ~148 per book

## Future Considerations

### Series 2: The Keepers (working title)
A follow-up 12-book series targeting ages 10–14 (middle grade) following the same characters 2–3 years older. Focused on New Testament and early church stories — the apostles, Paul's journeys, persecution, the spread of the gospel. Longer books (20–40k words), fewer illustrations (4–6 per book), more complex themes. To be developed after Series 1 is complete.

## Theological Guidelines

- **Denominationally neutral.** No specific church tradition named. Focus on Biblical text and God's character.
- **Biblically accurate.** Events follow scripture. Creative liberties are limited to the kids' interactions and the Pathfinder mechanics — not the Biblical narrative itself.
- **Age-appropriate.** Violence is present (David and Goliath, the lions, the Flood) but not graphic. The crucifixion is referenced in Book 12 but the focus is on Resurrection morning.
- **Not preachy.** The theology is woven into the adventure. The kids don't deliver sermons. The lessons emerge from what they witness and experience.
- **Honest about doubt.** Jordan's skepticism is treated respectfully. His questions are valid. His arc is gradual and earned.

## Key Narrative Decisions
- Palace intrigue, hidden identity, and genocide. The stakes are as high as they've ever been.
- The Fade targets Esther's rational, real fear — approaching the king uninvited means death. The Fade doesn't need to be supernatural here; the political reality is terrifying enough.
- **The Fade is now openly aggressive.** The kids realize it's not random — it's targeting the stories they haven't collected yet, trying to erase them before the kids arrive.
- Mordecai's line: "Who knows whether you have come to the kingdom for such a time as this?" This is the thesis of the book.
- The relic appears when Esther chooses to speak — not when the Jews are saved. The courage is the point, not the outcome.

## Chapter Beats
1. Present day. The Pathfinder is behaving differently — pulling them harder, urgently. Abuelo explains: "The closer you get to the end, the more it knows what's at stake."
2. The Persian court. Opulent, dangerous, full of power plays. Esther's hidden identity as a Jew.
3. Haman's plot. The decree to destroy the Jewish people. The horror of institutional evil.
4. Mordecai's plea. "For such a time as this." Esther's three days of fasting — not dramatic, just quiet, terrified determination.
5. The Fade saturates the palace. Esther's fear is overwhelming. Every rational instinct says stay silent.
6. Esther approaches the king uninvited. The longest walk of her life. The golden scepter extends.
7. The banquet. Esther reveals Haman's plot. The reversal. A jewel from her crown falls and glows.
8. Return. Tenth slot. Two remaining. The kids know the endgame is approaching. The Pathfinder hums almost constantly now.

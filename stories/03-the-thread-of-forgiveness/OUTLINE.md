## Key Narrative Decisions
- This is a **two-part adventure** with a time jump: the kids witness Joseph's betrayal, then jump forward to Egypt where Joseph has risen to power.
- The Fade's strategy shifts here — instead of general fog, it targets Joseph's specific pain, trying to turn it into bitterness when his brothers arrive begging for food.
- **Jordan's arc breakthrough:** This story hits close to home. Betrayal by family. Abandonment. He starts asking real questions, not just skeptical ones.
- The relic (thread from the coat) appears at the moment of forgiveness, not the moment of betrayal. The meaning is in the choice to forgive, not the act of being hurt.

## Chapter Beats

### Ch 1: Present day / Transport
- Abuelo journal: excavation notes from an Egyptian site, references to a Semitic vizier in Pharaoh's court.
- Pathfinder activates. The kids arrive in Canaan. A family of shepherds. Sibling tension immediately visible.

### Ch 2: The Coat
- They witness Jacob giving Joseph the coat. The brothers' jealousy is raw and ugly.
- Sofia: "This isn't going to end well." She can feel it.
- The coat is beautiful but it's a target on Joseph's back.

### Ch 3: The Pit
- Joseph's brothers seize him. The coat is torn. Joseph is thrown into the pit.
- This should be genuinely distressing — these are his *brothers*.
- Jordan watches the betrayal unfold and goes very quiet.
- The Fade is present as a numbing coldness. The brothers' guilt fades almost immediately. They sit down to eat.

### Ch 4: Sold
- Joseph sold to the Midianite traders. Dragged away.
- The brothers dip the torn coat in goat's blood.
- Jordan: "They're going to tell their father he's dead. Their own father."
- Time jump — the Pathfinder pulls them forward. Egypt. Years later.

### Ch 5: The Vizier
- Joseph as Pharaoh's right hand. Powerful, composed, unrecognizable from the boy in the pit.
- The kids see what suffering made: not a broken man but a leader.
- But underneath the composure, the pain is still there.

### Ch 6: The Brothers Arrive
- Famine drives the brothers to Egypt. They bow before Joseph. They don't recognize him.
- The Fade intensifies — targeting Joseph's pain. He has every right to punish them. Every reason.
- The bitterness is the Fade's weapon here: "They deserve this. Make them pay."

### Ch 7: The Choice
- Joseph's internal struggle. The kids can see it on his face — rage and love and grief fighting for control.
- Joseph reveals himself: "I am Joseph. Is my father still alive?"
- The forgiveness is staggering. The brothers are terrified. Joseph weeps.
- At the moment of forgiveness, a thread from the original coat — caught on a stone, preserved for decades — begins to glow.

### Ch 8: Return
- The relic secured. Third slot fills. Three notes harmonizing.
- Jordan is shaken. "He forgave them. After everything. How?"
- Eli: "Maybe that's the point. Maybe forgiveness isn't about what they deserve."
- Jordan doesn't respond. But he's thinking about his dad.

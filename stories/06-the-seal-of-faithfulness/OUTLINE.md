## Key Narrative Decisions
- This is a **political thriller**, not just a "man vs. lions" story. The trap is calculated. The jealousy is institutional. Daniel is targeted specifically because he won't compromise.
- The Fade manifests as "the reasonable voice" — suggesting Daniel could just pray quietly, in private, just this once. No one would know. The temptation of convenient compromise.
- **Series shift:** This book marks the Fade's transition from ambient atmosphere to active threat. The kids explicitly discuss that it's getting stronger.
- The tension is in Daniel's choice, not the lions. By the time he's in the den, the hard part is already done.
- Jordan sees something he can't dismiss: a man whose integrity is so consistent that his enemies can only attack him through his faithfulness.

## Chapter Beats
1. Present day. The kids discuss the Fade getting stronger. Abuelo, on the phone, pauses too long when they describe it. Transport to Babylon.
2. The Persian court. Political intrigue. Daniel's excellence makes him a target. The officials conspire.
3. The decree. No prayer to any god except the king. The trap is set. Daniel knows.
4. The Fade arrives as the voice of reason: "Just close the curtains. Pray silently. God will understand." Daniel opens his window and prays toward Jerusalem. As he always has.
5. Arrested. The king's anguish — Darius doesn't want this. But the law is the law. He sealed it himself.
6. The den. The seal stone pressed into place. The king's sleepless night. The kids wait in the darkness near the den.
7. Morning. The stone rolled away. Daniel alive. The Fade retreats from the den's mouth. The seal stone glows.
8. Return. Sixth slot. Jordan: "He didn't do anything special. He just didn't stop being who he was." The kids acknowledge: the Fade is changing. Something is escalating.

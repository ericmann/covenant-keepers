## Key Narrative Decisions
- **The quiet book.** No armies, no miracles, no fire from heaven. Just a widow, a foreigner, and a field. This is the counterpoint to the spectacle of the previous books.
- The Fade's strategy changes: it doesn't attack with fog or fear. It whispers that this story doesn't matter. It's too small. Too ordinary. Not worth preserving.
- **Sofia's turning point.** She's been chasing dramatic moments. Ruth's quiet, grinding faithfulness — gleaning in a field day after day — is the bravest thing she's ever seen.
- Boaz's kindness is not romantic (wrong age group) — it's *chesed*, covenantal lovingkindness. He sees Ruth and chooses generosity when he didn't have to.
- The Convergence arc begins. The Fade arrives before the kids — the field already feels dimmer when they land.

## Chapter Beats
1. Present day. The Fade is stronger between adventures now. Abuelo, home but frail, hints that some stories don't look important until you see how they connect.
2. Bethlehem. Famine aftermath. Naomi and Ruth arrive — two widows with nothing. The Fade is already here; the town feels grey.
3. Ruth goes to glean. Backbreaking work. The other gleaners avoid her — she's a foreigner, a Moabite.
4. Boaz notices her. His kindness is deliberate: leave extra grain, don't let the workers bother her. Small acts. Enormous impact.
5. Sofia wants something to happen. A battle. A miracle. "When does the exciting part start?" Eli: "I think this IS the exciting part."
6. Ruth's loyalty to Naomi. The famous words: "Where you go I will go." The Fade tries to make this feel like sentimentality instead of covenant.
7. The harvest gathered. A sheaf of grain glows faintly in Ruth's bundle. The relic appears at the moment of ordinary faithfulness, not dramatic triumph.
8. Return. Ninth slot. Sofia, quietly: "She never fought anyone. She never did anything... big. She just showed up. Every day." Long pause. "That might be harder than fighting a giant."

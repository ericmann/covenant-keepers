## Key Narrative Decisions
- The showdown: 450 prophets of Baal vs. one exhausted, afraid prophet of God.
- Elijah is NOT depicted as a confident hero. He's tired, alone, and scared. He's also sarcastic ("Maybe your god is sleeping!") — kids will love this.
- The hours of the prophets of Baal pleading to silence is the real tension. Not dramatic — just empty. Nothing answers.
- **Eli's crucible.** He's never been the "stand alone" type. He's the thinker, the careful one. This adventure forces him into Elijah's shoes metaphorically — choosing truth when the crowd disagrees.
- The Fade tries to make the fire from heaven seem like coincidence: a lightning strike, a trick of weather. It targets the *meaning*, not the event.

## Chapter Beats
1. Present day. Eli is anxious — the Fade is escalating and he feels responsible. Transport to Mount Carmel.
2. The setup: Israel divided. Ahab and Jezebel's corruption. The prophets of Baal everywhere. Elijah is a wanted man.
3. The challenge issued. 450 vs. 1. The odds are absurd. Sofia loves it. Jordan finds it reckless.
4. The prophets of Baal spend hours calling to their god. Nothing. Elijah taunts them. The silence of a false god is deafening.
5. Elijah builds the altar. Twelve stones. Drenches it in water three times. The Fade rolls in thick.
6. Elijah prays. Simple. Direct. Fire from heaven consumes everything — altar, stones, water, all of it.
7. The Fade tries to rewrite the moment: "Coincidence. Weather. Luck." But a stone from the altar glows through the fire.
8. Return. Seventh slot. Eli, shaking: "I don't know if I could have done what he did." Sofia: "You already have. Every time you pick up the Pathfinder."

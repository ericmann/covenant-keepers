## Key Narrative Decisions
- Jonah is NOT the hero of this story. He's the cautionary tale. He runs, pouts, and is furious when God shows mercy to people he considers enemies.
- The real story isn't the whale — it's Nineveh. Jonah's anger that God forgave them is the climax.
- **Series midpoint.** The kids discuss whether the Fade is getting stronger or if they're just noticing it more. Jordan says something that surprises everyone: "Maybe we're supposed to notice."
- Jordan identifies with running from something you don't fully believe in. Jonah ran from God. Jordan has been running from faith. The parallel is never stated explicitly — the reader (and Jordan) feel it.
- The Fade feeds Jonah's self-righteous anger — "They don't deserve mercy" is one of the most insidious lies in the series.

## Chapter Beats
1. Present day. Midpoint reflection — seven relics collected after this one. What's the pattern? Transport to Joppa, a harbor.
2. Jonah boarding a ship to Tarshish. He pays the fare. The coin changes hands. The kids follow.
3. The storm. The terror of the sailors. The casting of lots. Jonah admits fault.
4. Overboard. The great fish. Yes, the kids experience the inside — dark, awful, claustrophobic. Jonah prays.
5. Spit out on shore. Jonah goes to Nineveh — reluctantly, angrily.
6. Nineveh repents. Massively. The entire city turns. It should feel miraculous.
7. Jonah's fury. He wanted them destroyed. God's mercy enrages him. The Fade feeds this: "They don't deserve forgiveness." The vine, the worm, God's question.
8. The relic: the coin, found at the harbor where Jonah first ran, glowing. It appeared at the place of running, not the place of arrival. The meaning: second chances begin at the moment you recognize you're running.
9. Return. Jordan's midpoint observation. Eight slots filled. The tone is shifting.

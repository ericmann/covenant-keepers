## Chapter 1: The Hidden Room

*From the journal of Professor Hector Castillo:*
*June 3, 2019 — Valley of Elah, Israel*
*The streambed was almost dry today. I crouched there for an hour, turning smooth stones over in my hands. The right size, the right weight — the kind a shepherd boy could carry in a pouch. The valley is quiet now. Just wind and dry grass and the ghosts of two armies. I've spent forty years looking for evidence of God's faithfulness. Sometimes I wonder if I've been too afraid to simply trust it.*

---

Abuelo's house smelled like old books and cinnamon.

Eli noticed it the second Mom's car pulled into the driveway — that familiar smell leaking through the screen door like it had been waiting for them. The house was a tall, narrow Victorian with dark wood shutters and a porch that creaked in all the right places. Wind chimes made of old keys hung from the eaves, clinking in the June heat.

"Grab your bags," Mom said. She didn't get out of the car. Her eyes were red. "I need to get back to the hospital."

"Is Abuelo —" Eli started.

"He's stable. He fell yesterday, remember? They're keeping him for observation." She tried to smile. "He'd want you to make yourselves at home."

Sofia was already out of the car, backpack slung over one shoulder, staring up at the house like it was a fortress waiting to be conquered. "Race you to the attic," she said.

"There's no race," Eli said. But she was already gone.

The house was exactly like Eli remembered — maybe more so, like it had been concentrating on being itself while they were away. Bookshelves lined every hallway. Maps in languages Eli couldn't read were thumbtacked to the walls. A clay jar from somewhere ancient sat on the kitchen counter next to a box of Cheerios.

He was examining a framed photograph of Abuelo at a dig site when the doorbell rang.

The kid on the porch was about Eli's height, with dark hair that fell over his forehead and a look on his face like he'd already decided this conversation wasn't going to be interesting.

"Hey," the kid said. "My mom told me to come over and check on you. I'm Jordan. I live next door."

"I'm Eli. My sister's —"

"HERE." Sofia appeared behind Eli like she'd been teleported. "I'm Sofia. Want to explore? This house has, like, a thousand rooms."

Jordan looked at her, then at Eli, then at the house. He shrugged. "I mean, I was just going to say hi and leave, but... sure. There's nothing else to do."

That was how Jordan ended up with them when they found the room.

It was Sofia who noticed it, of course. She was running her hand along a bookshelf in the upstairs hallway — not reading the spines, just touching them, the way she touched everything — when her fingers caught on a brass latch hidden behind a thick book of maps.

"Eli. Come here."

"What?"

"There's a lock. No — a latch. Behind the books."

She pulled it before he could tell her to wait.

The bookshelf swung inward with a groan, and behind it was a room that smelled like dust and cedar and years of secrets kept.

Abuelo's hidden study.

It was smaller than Eli expected. Maps covered every wall, pinned with colored tacks and connected by strings. Journals were stacked on a long table in columns, each labeled by year. Glass cases held artifacts — a clay oil lamp, a bronze arrowhead, a fragment of cloth so old it looked like it might crumble if you breathed on it.

And on the desk, sitting on a leather cloth like it was the most important thing in the room — because it was — sat a bronze disc about the size of a dinner plate.

"What is *that*?" Jordan said from the doorway. He hadn't come all the way in. His arms were crossed.

Eli stepped closer. The disc was heavy-looking, with a greenish patina like very old bronze. Twelve small slots were arranged in a circle around its face, each engraved with a tiny symbol he couldn't quite make out. A stone. A branch. A horn. Others he'd need a magnifying glass to see.

"It looks like a compass," Sofia said. "A really old one."

"It's not a compass," Eli said, though he didn't know why he was so sure.

He reached out and picked it up.

It was warm. Not room-temperature warm — *alive* warm, like holding something with a heartbeat. And deep in his chest, so low he felt it more than heard it, something hummed.

## Chapter 2: The Valley

*From the journal of Professor Hector Castillo:*
*September 12, 2020 — Home office, after midnight*
*I've catalogued the disc six ways and I still can't identify the alloy. Bronze base, but the composition is wrong for any period I know. The twelve settings correspond to... something. Symbols I've seen scattered across a dozen dig sites on three continents. I think the device is a key. Or a vessel. Or both. But I can't make it do anything. It sits on my desk and does nothing. I'm beginning to believe it's waiting — not for the right artifact, but for the right person.*

---

The light came from everywhere.

Eli didn't remember closing his eyes, but they were shut — squeezed tight against a brightness that had flooded Abuelo's study like the sun had fallen through the ceiling. He could feel Sofia gripping his arm. He could hear Jordan saying something, but the words were lost in the hum, which had risen from his chest into his whole body, into the air, into everything.

Then it stopped.

Heat hit him first. Dry, heavy heat, the kind that sits on your skin and doesn't move. Then the smell — sweat and animals and dust and smoke from cooking fires. Then the sound: voices, hundreds of them, murmuring in a language he almost understood.

Eli opened his eyes.

They were standing on a hillside. Brown grass crunched under his sandals — *sandals?* He looked down. His sneakers were gone. He was wearing a rough, undyed tunic that itched at the neck. Sofia, beside him, was dressed the same way, her hair covered by a cloth. Jordan looked like he was wearing a burlap sack and wasn't happy about it.

"What," Jordan said flatly, "is happening."

Below them, spread across the ridge and spilling down toward a valley, was an army. Tents of animal hide stretched in uneven rows. Soldiers sat in clusters, sharpening weapons, eating, staring at the ground. Nobody was laughing. Nobody was talking loudly. The whole camp had the feel of a place where people were trying very hard not to think about something.

Across the valley — which was wide, with a shallow stream glinting at the bottom — was another camp. Bigger. Louder. Red and black banners snapping in the hot wind.

"Eli," Sofia breathed. "Do you know where we are?"

He did. He'd read about this valley in Abuelo's journals, seen it in photographs, traced the geography on maps pinned to the walls of the study that was now — somehow — very far away.

"The Valley of Elah," he said quietly.

"The what?" Jordan said.

"It's in Israel. It's where —"

A voice cut across the valley.

It was deep. So deep Eli felt it in his ribs. It echoed off the ridges and rolled through the camp like thunder that wouldn't stop. The soldiers around them flinched. Some stood up. Some looked away. One man near the cooking fire closed his eyes and pressed his lips together like he was praying.

The voice was speaking words Eli somehow understood, and they were terrible in their simplicity: *Send me your champion. Send someone to fight me. Or are you all cowards?*

"What is that?" Jordan whispered.

Eli looked across the valley. On the far ridge, in front of the other army, a figure stood alone. Even at this distance, Eli could tell the figure was enormous — a full head taller than anyone near him, with armor that caught the sun in blinding flashes of bronze. A spear rested over his shoulder like a fence post.

Sofia's hand found Eli's arm again. She squeezed hard.

"That's Goliath," Eli said.

He was not a cartoon. He was not a Sunday School flannel board. He was a man the size of a nightmare, and his voice carried across the valley like a physical thing, pressing against Eli's chest.

Jordan took a step backward. "Okay. This is a hallucination. We ate something bad. We're —"

"This is *amazing*," Sofia said, but her voice had a shake in it that Eli had never heard before.

Eli said nothing. He stood on the hillside above the Israelite camp, holding nothing, wearing someone else's clothes, three thousand years from home, and watched Goliath raise his spear toward the sky and roar.

## Chapter 3: Forty Days

*From the journal of Professor Hector Castillo:*
*June 4, 2019 — Valley of Elah, Israel*
*The Biblical text says Goliath challenged the Israelites twice a day for forty days. Forty days. I stood in this valley today and tried to imagine what that does to a person — hearing that voice at dawn and again at dusk, every single day, with no answer and no end in sight. Fear is rarely sudden. It's usually a slow erosion, like water wearing down stone. By day forty, those soldiers weren't afraid of Goliath anymore. They were afraid of everything.*

---

They fit in. Eli didn't understand how, but they did.

Nobody in the camp looked at them twice. The rough tunics, the sandals, the dust on their skin — the kids moved through the Israelite camp like they belonged there. Like the bronze disc had not only moved them through time but stitched them into the fabric of the place.

"Is anyone going to ask who we are?" Jordan said, ducking under a tent rope. "Because nobody's asking who we are, and that's weird."

"Just go with it," Sofia said.

"I *am* going with it. I'm pointing out that it's weird while going with it."

The camp was bigger than it looked from the ridge. Hundreds of tents. Cook fires sending thin smoke into the white sky. Soldiers everywhere — but not the kind of soldiers Eli had pictured. These men looked tired. Worn down. They ate without tasting their food. They checked their weapons but didn't sharpen them. Their eyes kept drifting toward the valley like they couldn't help it.

A trumpet sounded from the far ridge.

The camp went rigid. Every head turned. Eli watched soldiers grip their spears — not like men ready to fight, but like men holding on to something solid because the ground felt unsteady.

Goliath's voice rolled across the valley again. The same words. The same challenge. *Send me your champion.*

"How long has this been going on?" Jordan asked.

"Forty days," Eli said. "Twice a day for forty days."

"That would break anyone."

Eli nodded. That was exactly the point.

As the morning wore on, Eli noticed something else. At the far edges of the valley, where the hills rose into rocky ground, there was a mist. Faint — almost invisible in the bright sunlight. But the air there looked wrong. Washed out, like a photograph left in the sun too long.

And deep in his chest, quiet but steady, something hummed.

"Does it feel weird to you guys?" Eli said. "Not the time-travel weird. Something else."

"I'm cold," Sofia said. She rubbed her arms. "Which makes no sense because it's literally a million degrees."

Jordan squinted toward the hills. "Is that fog? It doesn't look like regular fog."

They didn't have a name for it. Not yet. But Eli felt it — a wrongness at the edges of the day, like something pressing in, trying to squeeze the color out.

They spent the afternoon watching the camp. Sofia wanted to explore; Eli wanted to understand. Jordan kept making observations nobody asked for that turned out to be useful.

"Those guys haven't moved in hours," he said, pointing to a group of soldiers near the supply tents. "And that officer has walked the same patrol route six times. He's not checking the perimeter. He's pacing. This whole army is stuck."

He was right. The fear wasn't dramatic — there was no screaming, no running. It was quieter than that. It was an army that had forgotten what it felt like to be brave.

Late in the afternoon, a commotion near the main road pulled them to the edge of camp. A boy — young, maybe Eli's age, maybe a year younger — was walking up the road carrying a sack of bread and a skin of something. Cheese, probably. He wore no armor. He carried no weapon except a sling looped over his belt, the way another kid might carry a jump rope.

His brothers met him at the edge of camp. They didn't look happy to see him.

"Go home, David," the oldest one snapped. "This isn't a place for you."

The boy — *David* — set down the bread and looked past his brothers, out toward the valley, where the last echoes of Goliath's afternoon challenge were still fading.

He didn't flinch.

Every soldier in earshot had flinched. Every one. Eli had watched them all day — the involuntary tightening of shoulders, the downward glance, the small step backward. Forty days of that voice had trained it into them, like a reflex they couldn't unlearn.

David just stood there, looking toward the valley like he was listening to something different than everyone else.

---

## Chapter 4: "Who Is This?"

*From the journal of Professor Hector Castillo:*
*June 5, 2019 — Valley of Elah, Israel*
*What strikes me about the text is David's question. Not "Can he be beaten?" Not "How tall is he?" David asks, "Who is this uncircumcised Philistine who defies the armies of the living God?" He reframed the entire situation. Every soldier saw a giant and measured themselves against him. David saw a giant and measured the giant against God. That question wasn't ignorance — it was the most aggressive act of faith in the chapter.*

---

David was causing a commotion.

From the edge of the supply tents, Eli watched the shepherd boy move through the camp like a stone dropped into still water. David talked to the soldiers — not to comfort them, not to gather intelligence, but to ask a question that nobody had thought to ask.

"Who is this guy?" David said to a cluster of spearmen. "Why is everyone afraid of him? He's defying the armies of the living God."

The soldiers stared at him. One of them laughed — not a mean laugh, more like the sound a person makes when they've forgotten what confidence looks like and are surprised to see it again.

David's brothers were furious.

"Why are you even here?" the oldest one hissed, grabbing David by the arm and pulling him aside. The kids were close enough to hear. "You left the sheep with nobody. You came down here to watch the battle like it's a game. Go *home*."

David pulled his arm free. He didn't raise his voice. "There *is* no battle. That's the problem."

Word traveled fast. Before the afternoon shadows reached the valley floor, David was standing in front of King Saul's tent.

The kids followed at a distance, moving through the camp's nervous energy. Nobody stopped them. Whatever the bronze disc had done, it had made them invisible in the way that children in a military camp are invisible — present but unimportant.

Saul's tent was large and richly decorated, but inside, the king looked small. He sat on a low stool, armor piled beside him like he'd taken it off and couldn't bring himself to put it back on. His advisors stood in a half-circle, looking at David with expressions that mixed pity and irritation.

"Let me fight him," David said.

Saul almost smiled. "You're a boy. He's been a warrior since before you were born."

"I've killed a lion," David said. "And a bear. They came after my father's sheep and I went after them. The Lord who delivered me from the lion and the bear will deliver me from this Philistine."

The tent was quiet. Through the flap, Eli could see the pale mist at the valley's edge — closer now, thicker. The air felt heavier, and the hum in his chest had tightened like a guitar string wound one turn too far. One of Saul's advisors leaned close to the king and whispered something. Eli caught only the shape of the words: *sending a boy to die.*

Saul looked at David for a long time. Then he stood.

"Wear my armor," the king said.

Eli watched David try on Saul's armor — the bronze helmet that sat too low over his eyes, the coat of mail that hung past his knees, the sword he could barely lift. David took two steps and stopped.

"I can't wear this," he said. Not embarrassed. Not apologetic. Simple and clear, like stating a fact about the weather. "I'm not used to it."

He took it off. Piece by piece. The helmet. The mail. The sword belt. He set them on the ground at Saul's feet and walked out of the tent with nothing but his staff, his sling, and the leather pouch at his belt.

Sofia grabbed Eli's arm. "He's going to the stream."

They followed. The late afternoon light turned the creek to copper. David crouched at the water's edge, his hand moving through the shallow current, fingers closing around stones — testing weight, smoothness, balance. He chose five. Dropped them one by one into his shepherd's bag.

Eli stared at those stones. Five smooth, ordinary stones, still wet from the creek. And somewhere deep behind his ribs, the hum surged.

"Eli?" Jordan said.

"Those stones," Eli whispered. "One of them is the relic. It has to be."

"Which one?"

Eli watched David stand, cinch the bag closed, and turn toward the valley. "I don't know yet."

## Chapter 5: The Stream

*From the journal of Professor Hector Castillo:*
*September 15, 2020 — Home office*
*I keep thinking about the space between knowing and understanding. I know the facts of David and Goliath. I could lecture on Philistine military tactics, the acoustic geography of the Elah Valley, the probable weight of Goliath's armor. But knowing all of that isn't the same as standing in the stream and picking up a stone when everything in you says run. I wonder sometimes if understanding is what the Pathfinder requires. Not knowledge. Understanding.*

---

"We have to get one of those stones."

Sofia said it like she was announcing they needed to grab an extra juice box from the cooler. Simple. Obvious. Let's go.

"We can't take his weapon right before a fight," Jordan said. "That's — even if this is a hallucination, that's messed up."

"He picked five. He only needs one."

"You don't know that. *He* doesn't know that."

"It's the David and Goliath story! One stone, one giant, done."

"Guys," Eli said.

They both looked at him. The creek murmured beside them. David was already walking away, back straight, toward the cluster of tents where Saul's officers stood in a tense knot.

"I don't think we're here to change anything," Eli said slowly. "The story happens how the story happens. We can't take the stone before the fight. That's not — I don't think that's how this works."

Jordan raised an eyebrow. "How *does* this work? Because I didn't get an instruction manual."

"Neither did I. But everything in Abuelo's journals says the same thing — these events are sacred. They happened the way they happened for a reason. If we mess with that..."

He trailed off. He didn't know what would happen. He just knew, in the same way he'd known the bronze disc wasn't a compass, that they were here to witness. Not to interfere.

"So we wait," Jordan said.

"We wait."

Sofia looked like waiting was a physical injury. She paced along the creek bank, kicking stones into the water, arms wrapped around herself.

"Are you okay?" Eli asked.

"I'm cold." She scowled at the sky. "Why am I *cold*? It's the desert."

Eli looked toward the valley. The mist he'd noticed earlier had thickened. It wasn't moving like natural fog — it crept along the ground in thin fingers, reaching up the hillside toward the camp. Where it touched, the grass looked grey. The late sunlight seemed dimmer, though the sky was clear.

The hum in his chest was louder now. Not painful, but insistent, like a warning he couldn't quite decode.

In the camp, soldiers were shifting restlessly. The cautious hope that had sparked when David spoke to Saul — that brief flicker of *maybe, maybe this kid is crazy enough to try* — was draining away. Eli watched a sergeant shake his head and turn from the valley. Two younger soldiers set down their spears and sat with their backs to the ridge, not watching anymore.

The fear was coming back. Not because of Goliath this time. Because of something quieter, something that pressed in at the edges and made the bright afternoon feel thin and fragile.

"Something's wrong," Eli said.

"Yeah," Jordan said. He was squinting, rubbing his eyes like he had dust in them. "Everything's blurry at the edges. I thought it was the heat."

It wasn't the heat. Eli didn't know what it was, but it wasn't the heat. It was the wrongness he'd felt since they arrived — amplified now, pushing against the fragile moment like a hand pressing down on a bruise.

From the ridge, Goliath's evening challenge thundered across the valley. The soldiers braced for it, the way you brace for a blow you know is coming and can't dodge. Shoulders tight. Eyes down.

But David was walking.

Eli saw him emerge from between the tents, staff in hand, sling at his side, the leather bag of stones bouncing against his hip. He walked past the officers who were still arguing. Past the soldiers who had stopped believing. Past the edge of camp and down the rocky slope toward the valley floor.

Alone.

No armor. No sword. No army behind him. Just a kid with a sling and five smooth stones and something inside him that the fog couldn't touch.

Sofia stopped pacing. Jordan stopped squinting. Eli stopped breathing.

David walked into the valley.

---

## Chapter 6: The Valley Floor

*From the journal of Professor Hector Castillo:*
*March 8, 2021 — Home office, 3 AM*
*I can't sleep. I keep coming back to the moment before the stone flies. That silence. Every battle has noise — the clash, the screaming, the chaos. But this one has a silence first. David speaks, Goliath mocks, and then there's a moment where the whole valley holds its breath. I think that silence is the point. It's the space between faith declared and faith proven. That's where courage lives — in the gap.*

---

The valley floor was wider than it looked from the ridge.

David crossed the streambed in three steps, water splashing over his sandals, and kept walking. The ground was hard-packed dirt, cracked from weeks of sun, littered with small stones that crunched under his feet. Every step carried across the silence.

Because it was silent. Completely, impossibly silent. Two armies on opposing ridges, thousands of soldiers, and not a single voice. Not a cough. Not the clink of armor. Just David's footsteps and the buzz of flies in the heat.

Eli, Sofia, and Jordan had followed as far as the streambed. They crouched behind a low outcrop of rock and watched.

Goliath started walking too.

He came down from the Philistine ridge like a landslide — slow, inevitable, so large that Eli's brain kept trying to recalculate the distance. *He can't be that big. He must be closer than I think.* But he wasn't closer. He was that big. His armor was bronze plate over bronze scale, and it caught the dying sunlight and threw it back in blinding fragments. His shield bearer walked ahead of him, and the shield bearer was a full-grown man who looked like a child next to the giant.

The ground vibrated with each step.

"Oh no," Sofia whispered.

The fog moved. Eli watched it slide down the hillside behind them and pour into the valley like something spilled. Colors drained where it passed — the brown dirt went grey, the green scrub along the creek went flat, even the sky seemed to lose a shade of blue. Sound muffled. The hum in Eli's chest was so loud now it was almost a sound outside his body.

Sofia was shivering. Jordan kept blinking, rubbing his eyes, his face tight with frustration.

On the ridge behind them, Eli could feel the army wavering. Not moving — wavering, like a candle flame in a draft. The thin hope was guttering out.

Goliath stopped thirty paces from David and laughed. It was an ugly sound, full of contempt.

"Am I a dog," the giant bellowed, "that you come at me with sticks?" He cursed David by his gods — names Eli didn't recognize, spoken with the confidence of a man who had never lost. "Come here, boy. I'll feed your flesh to the birds."

David didn't stop walking.

"You come to me with sword and spear and javelin," David said. His voice was clear — not loud, not deep, but *clear* in a way that cut through the muffled silence like a bell. "But I come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied."

The fog flinched.

Eli saw it — or felt it — a shudder in the grey mist, a pulling back, like something recoiling from a flame. For one moment, the colors sharpened. The sky was blue again. The dirt was brown. David's shadow stretched long and dark and solid across the valley floor.

David reached into his bag. One stone. He fitted it into the leather pouch of his sling.

Goliath raised his spear.

David ran.

Not away. *Forward.* Straight at the giant, feet pounding the dry ground, sling whipping in a tight circle above his head — once, twice — and then the sharp crack of release, and something small and fast cut across the distance between them like a thought.

The stone struck Goliath in the forehead.

The giant didn't stagger. He didn't stumble backward. He dropped. Straight down, like a tree cut at the base. The crash of his armor against the ground shook the valley floor and sent a cloud of dust billowing outward.

Silence.

One second. Two.

Then the valley exploded.

The Israelite army erupted from the ridge — screaming, surging forward, the fear of forty days burned away in a single, impossible moment. The Philistines broke. Eli could see them running, scattering across the far ridge like startled birds, and the grey fog that had crept into the valley scattered with them — shredding apart like mist in sudden sunlight, pulling back from the valley floor in ragged tatters until the air was clear and hot and bright.

Sofia grabbed Eli's shoulder. Her fingers were warm again.

"Eli. The stream. *Look.*"

He turned. The creek was churning with soldiers splashing through it, chasing the retreating army. But near the outcrop where they'd been crouching, in a shallow pool where the water eddied against the stones, something glowed.

Four stones sat in the streambed where David had knelt. Four of the five he'd chosen. And one of them — a small, smooth, pale stone no different from a thousand others — was shining with a faint, warm light, like a coal that hadn't quite gone out.

---

## Chapter 7: The Stone

*From the journal of Professor Hector Castillo:*
*November 2, 2020 — Home office*
*I've been wrong about the relics. I keep thinking of them as artifacts — objects with historical and spiritual significance, like a museum piece behind glass. But I'm starting to think they're more like anchors. They hold a moment in place. The stone isn't special because David threw it. It's special because of what David believed when he picked it up. The faith made the stone matter — not the other way around.*

---

The army swept past them like a river breaking its banks.

Soldiers poured down the hillside and through the stream, shouting and waving weapons, forty days of paralyzed fear converted into pure, reckless pursuit. The noise was enormous. After the silence of the confrontation, it felt like standing inside a thunderclap.

"Move!" Sofia grabbed Eli and Jordan and pulled them sideways, behind the outcrop, as a wave of soldiers crashed through the shallow water. "The stream — we need to get to the stones before someone steps on them!"

They scrambled over the rocks. The water was cold around Eli's ankles, shockingly cold after the day's heat. Soldiers rushed past on both sides, paying the three kids no attention at all.

The four remaining stones lay in a cluster where the current had nudged them against a flat rock. Three were ordinary — smooth, grey-brown, the kind of stone you'd skip across a pond without thinking. The fourth was glowing.

It wasn't bright. Not like a flashlight or a lamp. More like the warmth of a hand held close to your face in the dark — you couldn't quite see the light, but you knew it was there. The stone pulsed with a soft, amber glow that seemed to come from inside, as if someone had lit a match at its core.

Eli knelt in the stream. The water swirled around his knees.

"That's it," Jordan said. He was staring at the stone with an expression Eli couldn't read — not disbelief, exactly. More like a person watching a magic trick and trying to decide whether to be amazed or suspicious. "That's the relic."

"Pick it up," Sofia urged. "Before someone —"

"Wait." Eli held up his hand. The hum was back — or rather, it had never left, but now it had changed. It wasn't a warning anymore. It was something gentler. An invitation.

He looked at the stone and thought about David. Not David the hero. Not David the giant-killer. David the kid. A boy his age who'd walked into a valley full of fear and said something so simple it was almost ridiculous: *The Lord will deliver me.*

Not *I'm strong enough.* Not *I have a plan.* Not *I've figured out the angle and the velocity.* None of that. Just trust. Plain, undecorated, I-don't-know-how-this-ends-but-I-know-Who-I-trust faith.

The stone was just a stone. It could have been any stone from any stream in any country. David's courage wasn't in the rock. It was in the hand that threw it — or, deeper than that, in the heart that trusted God when trusting made no sense at all.

Eli understood.

Not just the facts. Not just the story he'd heard in Sunday School a dozen times. He understood it the way you understand cold water — not because someone described it, but because you were standing in it.

He reached down and picked up the stone.

It was warm. The same alive warmth as the Pathfinder — that sense of holding something with a heartbeat. The glow brightened in Eli's palm, then settled into a steady, soft pulse.

"Whoa," Sofia whispered.

Jordan opened his mouth, closed it, and opened it again. Nothing came out.

The hum rose. Not just in Eli's chest now — in the air, in the water, in the stones beneath their feet. It climbed in pitch and volume, a single note that was almost musical, almost a voice, until the air itself seemed to vibrate with it and the valley and the creek and the armies began to blur at the edges.

"Something's happening," Jordan said.

"Hold on," Eli said, though he didn't know what to hold on to.

The light spread from the stone in his hand — not harsh, not blinding, but warm and total, filling the valley, erasing the creek and the rocks and the sky, replacing everything with pure, golden brightness.

Eli felt Sofia's hand on his arm. Jordan's shoulder against his. The warmth of the stone against his palm. And then — gently, like waking from a dream you didn't want to leave — the world dissolved.

---

## Chapter 8: The First Slot

*From the journal of Professor Hector Castillo:*
*December 24, 2020 — Home office, Christmas Eve*
*The house is quiet tonight. Eli and Sofia sent a video — they've gotten so big. Sofia lost another tooth. Eli is reading a book about archaeology. Probably my fault. I sat with the Pathfinder tonight and thought about the people it was made for. Not me. I've always known that, even when I didn't want to admit it. It's waiting for someone braver. Someone young enough to believe without needing proof first. I pray I get to see it.*

---

The first thing Eli noticed was the smell. Old books and cinnamon.

He was standing in Abuelo's study. The same study. The same desk. The same maps pinned to the walls, the same journals stacked in columns. Late afternoon light slanted through the single window, catching the dust motes at the same angle as when they'd left.

The same moment. No time had passed at all.

The Pathfinder sat on the desk in front of him. And in his right hand, smooth and warm and impossible, he was still holding the stone.

"Did that just —" Jordan started.

"Yes," Sofia said.

"And we were really —"

"*Yes.*"

Jordan looked down at himself. Sneakers. T-shirt. No rough tunic. He touched his face like he was checking to make sure it was still his.

"That was real," he said. It wasn't a question. It wasn't quite belief, either. It was the sound of someone standing at the edge of something enormous — not ready to step over, but not willing to step back.

Eli looked at the stone in his hand. In Abuelo's study, it had stopped glowing — but it was still warm. Still smooth. Still holding the heat of a valley three thousand years gone.

He looked at the Pathfinder.

Twelve slots stared up at him. Twelve small circles, each engraved with a symbol. The first one — a tiny carved stone — matched the shape of the relic in his palm perfectly.

Eli placed the stone in the slot.

It clicked into place with a sound that was too perfect to be mechanical — a small, clean *snick*, like the last piece of a puzzle finding its home. The slot lit up, a soft amber glow, and the Pathfinder hummed. Not the warning hum. Not the rising crescendo. A single, clear note, like a tuning fork struck once and held. Almost music. Almost a voice.

The three of them stared at the device. One slot filled, glowing warm. Eleven empty, dark.

Sofia grinned. It was her full grin — the one that meant trouble and adventure and *let's go* all at once. "When do we go again?"

"We don't even know how it works," Jordan said. But he was leaning closer, studying the Pathfinder with something that looked dangerously close to curiosity.

Eli's eyes drifted to the journals stacked on the desk. He picked up the one on top — a leather-bound notebook with a cracked spine and Abuelo's careful handwriting on the cover: *Field Notes, Volume 47.* He opened it to a page near the back.

A sketch. An olive branch, drawn in quick, confident pencil strokes. Notes scattered around the margins in Abuelo's tight handwriting: *Genesis 8:11. The dove returned with a fresh olive leaf. A sign. A promise kept.* Below the sketch, circled twice in faded ink: *A flood. A dove. A branch. The first covenant.*

Eli closed the journal and looked at the Pathfinder. It pulsed once — faint, barely visible, like a heartbeat settling into rhythm.

Outside, the summer evening was just beginning. Crickets were starting up in Abuelo's garden. Somewhere down the street, a dog barked. The world was ordinary and familiar and completely unchanged.

But Eli wasn't. None of them were.

He set the journal down and looked at his sister, who was already reaching for another notebook, and at Jordan, who was pretending he wasn't interested while reading the spines of every book on the nearest shelf.

Eleven empty slots. Eleven promises waiting to be remembered.

The Pathfinder hummed its single, quiet note in the fading light, patient as a prayer.

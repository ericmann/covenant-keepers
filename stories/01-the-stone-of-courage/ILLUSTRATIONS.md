# Book 1: The Stone of Courage — Illustration Specifications

## Style Direction

- **Interior:** Simple black-and-white line drawings. Clean composition with a single clear focal point per illustration. Minimal background detail — suggest setting with a few confident strokes rather than filling every inch. Think classic chapter-book illustrations: evocative, not exhaustive.
- **Cover:** Full color, but restrained. Limited palette (warm golds, dusty browns, bronze tones against a cool blue sky). One strong composition, not a collage of elements. The cover should feel like a moment, not a summary.
- **Line weight:** Medium, with variation for depth and emphasis. Heavier lines for foreground subjects, lighter for environmental suggestion.
- **Characters:** Semi-realistic. Not cartoonish, not photorealistic. Must be recognizable and consistent across all 12 books. Establish model sheets with the illustrator before beginning.
- **The Fade:** When present, represented as a few wisps of textured fog at the margins. Subtle enough that a first-time reader might not notice, but recognizable to returning readers.
- **The Pathfinder:** Consistent design in every appearance. Bronze, circular, twelve slots. Simple enough to be recognizable at small sizes.

## Cover Art (Full Color)

**Scene:** The three kids standing at the edge of a hillside, looking down into a wide valley. In the middle distance, a single small figure (David) walks toward a single massive silhouette (Goliath). The valley stretches between two ridgelines — armies suggested by a few tents and banners, not rendered in detail.

**Mood:** Wonder and tension. Golden late-afternoon light. The kids are small against the landscape, but leaning forward — drawn in, not shrinking back.

**Composition:** The kids in the lower foreground (backs or three-quarter view), the valley filling the middle ground, David and Goliath as the focal point. Lots of sky. Open, not crowded.

**Series elements:** The Pathfinder visible at Eli's belt or in his hand, but not prominently featured. Series title treatment and book number. Consistent spine design for shelf recognition.

**What to avoid:** Don't try to show the armies in detail. Don't show the camp, the stream, the fog, and the fight all at once. One moment, one feeling.

## Interior Illustrations (8 × B&W Line Art)

### Illustration 1 — "The Hidden Study"
**Placement:** Chapter 1, after the bookcase opens
**Scene:** The three kids framed by the open bookcase doorway, peering into shadow. Eli in front, Sofia pushing past, Jordan hanging back. The room beyond is suggested by a few shapes — the corner of a map, the edge of a desk, a faint glow from the Pathfinder.
**Focus:** The kids' body language and the doorway. The study is mystery, not inventory.
**Size:** Half-page

### Illustration 2 — "The Pathfinder"
**Placement:** Chapter 1, when Eli picks it up
**Scene:** Close-up of the Pathfinder in Eli's hands. A bronze disc with twelve empty slots in a circle, each marked with a small symbol. Light beginning to emanate from the center. Eli's fingers curled around the edges.
**Focus:** The device itself. This establishes the most important recurring object in the series. Keep the symbols small but distinct.
**Size:** Quarter-page, centered

### Illustration 3 — "The Valley"
**Placement:** Chapter 2, upon arrival
**Scene:** Wide landscape view — two ridgelines with a valley between them, a thin stream at the bottom. A few tents on the near ridge suggest the Israelite camp. The far ridge is a dark line with a single oversized figure standing at its edge.
**Focus:** Scale and geography. The valley should feel vast and hot. Minimal detail — let the empty space do the work.
**Size:** Full-page or three-quarter page

### Illustration 4 — "Goliath's Challenge"
**Placement:** Chapter 2 or 3, first clear sight of Goliath
**Scene:** Goliath from below, seen past the shoulders of a few Israelite soldiers who are pulling back. He is massive — the size difference is the entire point. Spear over one shoulder, armor suggested with a few bold lines.
**Focus:** The size contrast. Goliath imposing but not grotesque. The soldiers' body language tells the story — hunched, leaning away.
**Size:** Half-page

### Illustration 5 — "David Arrives"
**Placement:** Chapter 3, when the kids spot David
**Scene:** David walking up the camp road, carrying a sack. He's young, unarmored, ordinary. His oldest brother stands with arms crossed, turning away. David is looking past him, toward the valley.
**Focus:** David's expression — calm, direct, unheroic. He looks like a kid, not a legend. No glow, no halo. Just a boy who isn't afraid.
**Size:** Half-page

### Illustration 6 — "Five Smooth Stones"
**Placement:** Chapter 4 or 5, David selecting stones
**Scene:** David's hand reaching into the stream, fingers closing around a smooth stone. Water ripples outward. A few other stones visible beneath the clear surface.
**Focus:** The hand and the water. An intimate, quiet moment. No background detail needed — this is about the gesture.
**Size:** Quarter-page

### Illustration 7 — "The Valley Floor"
**Placement:** Chapter 6, the confrontation
**Scene:** David walking across the empty valley floor toward Goliath. David is small. Goliath is enormous. A wide gap of bare ground between them. At the very edges of the illustration, a few wisps of fog curl inward — the Fade, barely there.
**Focus:** The space between them. David moving forward, Goliath stationary. This is the centerpiece illustration of the book.
**Size:** Full-page

### Illustration 8 — "The First Slot"
**Placement:** Chapter 8, placing the relic
**Scene:** Eli's hand placing the smooth stone into the first slot of the Pathfinder. The slot glows. The other eleven slots are dark and empty. Sofia and Jordan visible in the background — Sofia grinning, Jordan leaning in with guarded curiosity.
**Focus:** The glowing slot and the contrast with the empty ones. Warm light from the single filled slot; the rest in shadow.
**Size:** Half-page

## AI Concept Art Notes

For each illustration, generate 2–3 concept images using image generation tools to provide the illustrator with:
- Composition and framing direction
- Character positioning and body language
- Mood and lighting reference

Annotate each AI reference image with notes on what to keep and what to change. The illustrator should interpret the concepts in their own consistent style, not reproduce the AI output.

## Consistency Notes (Apply to All 12 Books)

- **The Fade:** Always fog/mist with a slightly different texture than natural weather. Kept to the margins in Books 1–4.
- **The Pathfinder:** Same design in every appearance. The number of glowing slots should match the book number minus one (Book 1 ends with 1 slot filled, Book 2 begins with 1 and ends with 2, etc.).
- **Characters:** Consistent clothing, hair, build across all books. Establish model sheets before beginning illustration work.

# Book 1: The Stone of Courage — Illustration Specifications

## Cover Art (Full Color)
**Scene:** The three kids standing at the edge of the Valley of Elah, looking down. In the distance, two armies face each other across the valley. A small figure (David) walks alone toward a massive silhouette (Goliath).
**Mood:** Wonder mixed with danger. Golden light from the setting sun. The kids are small against a vast landscape.
**Series elements:** The Pathfinder device should be prominent. Series title treatment and book number. Consistent spine design for shelf recognition.

## Interior Illustrations (8 × B&W Line Art)

### Illustration 1 — "The Hidden Study"
**Placement:** Chapter 1, after the bookcase opens
**Scene:** The three kids peering into Abuelo's hidden study. Eli in front, Sofia pushing past him, Jordan hanging back with arms crossed. The room is cluttered with maps, journals, artifacts, and a globe. The Pathfinder sits on the desk, faintly illuminated.
**Key details:** The study should feel lived-in and magical — a lifetime of searching. Books stacked haphazardly. Maps pinned to walls with notes. The Pathfinder should draw the eye.
**Size:** Half-page

### Illustration 2 — "The Pathfinder"
**Placement:** Chapter 1, when Eli picks it up
**Scene:** Close-up of the Pathfinder in Eli's hands. A bronze disc with twelve empty slots arranged in a circle, each engraved with a small symbol (a stone, a branch, a horn, a star, etc.). Eli's fingers curled around the edges. Light beginning to emanate from the center.
**Key details:** This is the most important recurring object in the series. Its design must be established here and remain consistent across all 12 books. The symbols in each slot should be small but distinct enough to identify.
**Size:** Quarter-page, centered

### Illustration 3 — "The Valley of Elah"
**Placement:** Chapter 2, upon arrival
**Scene:** Wide landscape view of the Valley of Elah from the hillside. Two encampments visible on opposite ridges. The Israelite camp in the foreground (tents, cooking fires, soldiers). The Philistine camp across the valley. The streambed running through the middle.
**Key details:** Should convey scale and the geography of the confrontation. The valley should feel real and hot and dusty.
**Size:** Full-page or three-quarter page

### Illustration 4 — "Goliath's Challenge"
**Placement:** Chapter 2 or 3, first sight of Goliath
**Scene:** Goliath standing at the edge of the valley, armor glinting, spear over his shoulder. Viewed from behind the Israelite soldiers who are shrinking back. The kids visible in the crowd, looking up. Goliath should be massive relative to everyone else.
**Key details:** Goliath should feel real and threatening, not cartoonish. Armor details from the Biblical description (bronze helmet, coat of mail, bronze greaves). He should be imposing without being gratuitously scary for 8-year-olds.
**Size:** Half-page

### Illustration 5 — "David Arrives"
**Placement:** Chapter 3, when the kids spot David
**Scene:** David arriving at the camp carrying food for his brothers. He's young — about Eli's age — and unarmored. His brothers are dismissive, turning away. David is looking past them toward the valley with a determined expression.
**Key details:** David should look like a kid, not a hero. No halo, no glowing aura. Just a shepherd boy with a sling and a bag of bread who happens to not be afraid.
**Size:** Half-page

### Illustration 6 — "The Streambed"
**Placement:** Chapter 4 or 5, David selecting stones
**Scene:** David crouching at the edge of the stream, hand in the water, selecting smooth stones. The water is clear. Five stones visible — four in his hand, one still in the water. Eli watching from a few paces away, recognizing the moment.
**Key details:** Intimate scene. The focus is on David's hands and the stones. The water should feel cold and real.
**Size:** Quarter-page

### Illustration 7 — "The Valley Floor"
**Placement:** Chapter 6, the confrontation
**Scene:** David walking toward Goliath across the valley floor. David is tiny. Goliath is enormous. The fog of the Fade creeps in from the edges of the illustration — a visual representation of the encroaching doubt. But David walks forward.
**Key details:** The scale contrast is everything. David small but moving forward. Goliath massive but stationary. The Fade fog should be subtle — a reader might not notice it the first time but will recognize it in later books.
**Size:** Full-page (the centerpiece illustration)

### Illustration 8 — "The First Slot"
**Placement:** Chapter 8, placing the relic
**Scene:** Back in Abuelo's study. Eli placing the smooth stone into the first slot of the Pathfinder. The slot glows. Sofia and Jordan watching — Sofia grinning, Jordan with an expression that's not quite belief but not denial. The other eleven slots sit empty.
**Key details:** The warm glow of the first slot should contrast with the dark, empty remaining slots. This image establishes the visual pattern for the "return" scene in every subsequent book.
**Size:** Half-page

## AI Concept Art Notes
For each illustration, generate 2-3 concept images using Midjourney/DALL-E/similar to provide the illustrator with:
- Composition and framing direction
- Character positioning and body language
- Mood and lighting reference
- Specific details to include or avoid

Annotate each AI reference image with notes on what to keep and what to change. The illustrator should interpret the concepts in their own consistent style, not reproduce the AI output.

## Style Guidelines (apply to all 12 books)
- **Line weight:** Medium, with variation for depth
- **Style:** Semi-realistic. Not cartoonish, not photorealistic. Think classic Narnia or early Harry Potter chapter illustrations.
- **Characters:** Must be recognizable and consistent across all 12 books. Establish model sheets with the illustrator before beginning.
- **The Fade:** Always represented as encroaching fog/mist with slightly different texture than natural weather. Should be recognizable as "the Fade" to returning readers.
- **The Pathfinder:** Consistent design in every appearance. Bronze, circular, twelve slots. This is the visual anchor of the series.

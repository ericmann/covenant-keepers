## Key Narrative Decisions
- The kids arrive during the **building of the Ark**, not during the flood. The story is about the years of obedience and mockery, not disaster spectacle.
- Noah's neighbors mock him relentlessly. This is slow-burn social pressure, not dramatic confrontation.
- The Fade works to make Noah question whether he heard God correctly.
- The relic isn't on the Ark — the kids have to wait through the storm to find it. The dove returns with the olive branch *after* the flood.
- Jordan connects with Noah's isolation — doing something everyone says is crazy because you believe something no one else does.

## Chapter Beats

### Ch 1: "Abuelo's Second Entry"
- Present day: Kids still processing Book 1. The Pathfinder activates again.
- Abuelo journal entry about a dig near Mount Ararat, the difficulty of searching for something everyone says doesn't exist.
- Transport to a pre-flood settlement. Heat, noise, civilization.

### Ch 2: "The Builder"
- They find Noah and his family building the Ark. It's enormous and half-finished.
- The neighbors mock openly. Noah's sons work grimly. Noah himself is steady but visibly tired.
- Jordan's observation: "He's either crazy or the bravest person I've ever seen."

### Ch 3: "The Mockery"
- Extended immersion in the social cost of Noah's obedience.
- Sofia is furious at the mockers. Eli holds her back.
- The Fade manifests as a subtle wrongness — the sky is too clear, the sun too bright. Everything *looks* fine. Which is exactly the problem.

### Ch 4: "The Door"
- The animals begin arriving. The mood shifts from mockery to unease.
- Noah's family enters the Ark. God closes the door.
- The kids are inside. Jordan didn't mean to be. Now he's trapped on a boat with a man he's not sure he believes.

### Ch 5: "The Rain"
- The flood. Experienced from inside the Ark — the sound, the rocking, the fear.
- Not a spectacle. Claustrophobic, dark, frightening.
- The Fade intensifies — Noah's faith wavers in the darkness. "Did I hear correctly?"

### Ch 6: "Forty Days"
- Waiting. The hardest part of faith. Nothing to do but trust.
- The kids help with the animals. Jordan and Noah have a quiet conversation. Noah admits he was afraid. Jordan didn't expect that.

### Ch 7: "The Dove"
- Noah sends out the raven, then the dove. The dove returns with nothing.
- Second time: the dove returns with an olive branch. The branch glows faintly in the dove's beak.
- The relic reveals itself because the kids understand: the promise wasn't the flood ending. The promise was that God remembered them.

### Ch 8: "The Rainbow"
- The kids secure the branch. The Pathfinder pulls them back.
- Second slot fills. The hum becomes richer — two notes now.
- Jordan, quietly: "He waited a year on that boat. Because he believed something he couldn't see."
- Eli opens Abuelo's journal. A sketch of a colorful coat. Notes about a boy sold by his brothers.

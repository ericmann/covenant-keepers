## Key Narrative Decisions
- **The Escalation arc begins.** The Fade is noticeably more aggressive. It arrives before the climactic moment, not after.
- The absurdity of God's plan is the story: a military operation that looks like a parade. Seven days of silent marching. No battle plan. Just walk.
- Sofia is furious at the pace. She wants to DO something. This is her confrontation with the truth that obedience and patience are not weakness.
- Jordan's observation: "This is either the dumbest military strategy in history or..." He doesn't finish the sentence.
- The Fade feeds confusion and embarrassment — the Israelites start questioning whether Joshua heard God correctly.

## Chapter Beats
1. Present day. The kids notice the Fade's detection signals are sharper now. Something is changing. Transport to outside Jericho.
2. The walls of Jericho. Massive, imposing. The Israelite camp. Joshua's instructions: march. Silently. For seven days.
3. Day 1–3. The march. Silence. The people of Jericho mock from the walls. Sofia is climbing the walls (figuratively). "WHY are we just walking?"
4. Day 4–5. The Fade arrives — earlier than any previous adventure. Doubt spreads through the ranks. Soldiers whisper about mutiny.
5. Day 6. Sofia nearly breaks rank. Eli stops her. Their biggest argument yet. "Trust the process" vs. "This is insane."
6. Day 7. Seven circuits. The tension is unbearable. The Fade is thick. Then the trumpets. Then the shout.
7. The walls fall. The horn cracks. A piece of it glows. Sofia understands: patience wasn't passivity. It was the hardest kind of courage.
8. Return. Fifth slot. Sofia, quietly: "I hate waiting." Eli: "I know." Sofia: "But I think that's the point."

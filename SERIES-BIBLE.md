# Series Bible — Covenant Keepers

## Premise

Twelve-year-old Eli Castillo and his ten-year-old sister Sofia are spending the summer with their grandfather, Professor Hector "Abuelo" Castillo, a retired Biblical archaeologist. When Abuelo is hospitalized after a fall, the kids and their skeptical neighbor Jordan Park discover a hidden study in his house containing a lifetime of research — and a strange bronze device called the Pathfinder.

The Pathfinder is an ancient compass-like instrument with twelve empty settings arranged like a clock face, each engraved with a symbol. When Eli touches it, the device activates and pulls the three kids backward through time into a Biblical event.

Through Abuelo's journals, their mission becomes clear: twelve Covenant Relics are scattered across sacred history. Each is a physical artifact from a moment where God's faithfulness was on display. An unseen force — the Fade — is working to erase these moments from memory. The kids must find each relic, witness the event firsthand, and return the relic to the Pathfinder before the memory is lost.

## The Pathfinder

- Bronze, heavy, warm to the touch
- Twelve slots arranged in a circle, each engraved with a symbol corresponding to a relic
- When a relic is placed, the slot glows faintly and the Pathfinder hums
- As more slots fill, the hum becomes a tone — almost like music
- It is never explained what the Pathfinder is or who made it. It is old. It is purpose-built. And it chose these kids.
- In Book 12, the completed Pathfinder opens to reveal a mirror — reflecting the character of God back to whoever holds it

## The Fade

The series antagonist is not a person but a force. The Fade is a creeping, cold erasure that moves through the Biblical timeline, dimming memories and weakening the connections between God's promises and His people.

**Manifestation:** Grey fog, patches of silence, colors draining, people suddenly doubting what they've witnessed.

**Detection:** Sofia gets cold. Eli hears a low hum. Jordan's vision blurs at the edges.

**Behavior across the series:**
- Books 1–4: Peripheral. A creeping fog on the edges. Present but not aggressive.
- Books 5–8: Arrives earlier in each adventure. More assertive. Forces the kids to work faster.
- Books 9–11: Actively pursues them. Adventures become more dangerous.
- Book 12: Strongest assault. Manifests as grief, despair, and the weight of "it's over."

**Why the Fade (not Satan):** Avoids the theological complexity of personifying Satan for 8-year-olds while creating real tension. It mirrors a real spiritual concept — the enemy's primary tool isn't dramatic confrontation but quiet erosion of faith. Kids understand the feeling of forgetting something important, of doubt creeping in, of a bright memory going dim.

**Critical rule:** The Fade cannot touch the kids directly. It can only influence the people around them — and their own doubts.

## The Rules

These are discovered gradually across the first few books:

1. The kids can observe and interact but **cannot change the outcome** of Biblical events. History will happen as written.
2. The relic reveals itself only when the kids **understand the meaning** of the moment, not just the facts.
3. The Fade cannot touch the kids directly, but it can influence the people around them — and it can influence their doubts.
4. Time in the present **pauses** while they're in the past. They always return to the same moment they left.
5. The Pathfinder returns them when the relic is secured — they can't choose to stay.

## Series Arc

### Books 1–4: Foundation
The kids are learning the rules. Adventures are somewhat self-contained. They're getting their footing, learning to work as a team, and beginning to trust the process. The Fade is present but peripheral.

### Books 5–8: Escalation
The Fade grows bolder, arriving earlier and more aggressively. The kids start finding connections between the relics — the promises aren't isolated; they build on each other. Jordan's skepticism begins softening, but he wrestles honestly with doubt.

### Books 9–11: Convergence
The Fade actively pursues them. Adventures become more dangerous. The kids realize the relics are forming something in the Pathfinder. Abuelo, recovering slowly, shares more of what he knows.

### Book 12: Culmination
The final relic. The Fade's strongest push. Everything the kids have learned comes together. The completed Pathfinder reveals its true purpose — not a weapon, not a map, but a mirror reflecting the character of God.

## Chapter Structure Template

Each book follows roughly this structure:

1. **Present day:** Setup at Abuelo's house. A journal entry hints at the next adventure. The Pathfinder activates.
2. **Arrival:** The kids land in the Biblical setting. Disorientation, then discovery.
3. **Immersion:** They meet the key figures, experience the culture, understand the stakes.
4. **Rising tension:** The Fade appears. The critical moment is in danger.
5. **Crisis:** The moment of truth — for the Biblical figure and for the kids.
6. **Relic:** The artifact reveals itself. The kids understand the promise.
7. **Return:** Back in the present. Relic placed in the Pathfinder. Brief reflection. Hook toward next adventure.

## Abuelo's Journal

Each chapter opens with a short excerpt from Abuelo's field journal. These entries:
- Are dated and handwritten in tone
- Mix archaeological detail with personal reflection
- Ground the Biblical event in real-world history (actual locations, artifacts, cultural context)
- Reveal Abuelo's personality and lifetime of searching
- Become more personal and urgent in later books
- Eventually hint that Abuelo knew more about the Fade than he let on

## Continuity Checkpoints

When drafting any book, verify:
- How many relics have been collected so far? The Pathfinder should reflect this.
- What is the Fade's current aggression level for this book's position in the series?
- Where is Abuelo in his recovery? (Hospitalized books 1–3, beginning to communicate books 4–7, more present books 8–11, fully present book 12)
- Where is Jordan in his arc? (Bewildered 1–2, curious 3–5, genuinely questioning 6–8, on the verge 9–11, choosing faith 12)
- What do the kids know about the rules? (Discovering 1–3, understanding 4–6, testing limits 7–9, mastering 10–12)
